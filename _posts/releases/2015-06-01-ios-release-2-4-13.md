# iOS 2.4.13 Release Notes

Released June 01, 2015

* [NEW] New public API methods on ARProfileManager to get the Artisan Id and Push Token for the current device. These values can be useful for integrating with third-party analytics or push services or connecting with the upcoming Artisan web APIs. For more information see <a href="/dev/ios/user-profiles/#artisan-id">User Profiles</a>. The same information is available from our <a href="">Javascript SDK</a> as well.
* [UPDATED] When registering user profile variables you can no longer register the same variable twice. If you do, the second registration will have no effect.
* [FIXED] We have dramatically improved the startup time for Artisan. The gains are more apparent on simulators, but you may find improvements from 50-90%.
