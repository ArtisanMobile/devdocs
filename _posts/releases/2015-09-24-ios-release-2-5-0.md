# iOS 2.5.0 Release Notes

Released September 24, 2015

* [NEW] The Artisan SDK is now built for iOS 9, including support for Bitcode builds.

**NOTE: For the iOS 9 SDK build, you'll want to whitelist Amazon S3 (amazonaws.com) to ensure In-App Message assets can be properly downloaded.  You can do this by adding the following stanza to your app's `Info.plist` file.**

{% highlight xml %}
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
  <dict>
    <key>amazonaws.com</key>
    <dict>
      <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
      <false/>
      <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
      <true/>
    </dict>
  </dict>
</dict>
{% endhighlight %}
