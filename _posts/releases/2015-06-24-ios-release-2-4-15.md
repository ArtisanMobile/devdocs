# iOS 2.4.15 Release Notes

Released June 24, 2015

* [UPDATED] This version of the Artisan iOS SDK has been tested against iOS 9 Beta and XCode 7. This release includes a fix to a critical issue related to the application delegate that prevented apps from loading properly in this beta version of the OS. There is a known issue with networking as of this Artisan release that we will be monitoring and updating as updates to iOS 9 and XCode 7 are released. These issues are not present in previous versions of iOS or XCode.
* [FIXED] Fixed handling <a href="/dev/ios/event-tracking/#trackevent">custom track event</a> calls so that they will not risk being ignored if called very early in the app lifecycle before Artisan is completely started up.
