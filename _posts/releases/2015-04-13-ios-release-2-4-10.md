# iOS 2.4.10 Release Notes

Released April 13, 2015

Fixed a critical issue that produced occasional crashes in iOS 8.1 & 8.2 apps when the user has certain iOS Accessibility features enabled.  

* [FIXED] Eliminated all proxying of delegates for UITableViews and UICollectionViews to eliminate crashes introduced by updated Apple Accessibility features.  See <a href="/dev/ios/event-tracking/#table-and-collection-view">UITableView and UICollectionView Event Tracking</a> for additional configuration information.

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Because of the issue addressed in this release of the Artisan iOS SDK, we recommend that all users upgrade to this version of the SDK or greater.</p>
