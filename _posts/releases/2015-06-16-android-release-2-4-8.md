# Android 2.4.8 Release Notes

Released June 17, 2015

* [NEW] There's a new version variable type for Artisan user profiles. Versions are useful for tracking numeric values like api versions or app versions (2.4.8 or 2.5-RELEASE, for example). Artisan automatically collects your app's current version as a profile variable, but if you have any other version that would be useful for segmenting your user base for analytic purposes or targeting changes to your app, see these new API methods. For more information see <a href="/dev/android/user-profiles/#register">Registering Custom User Profile Variables</a>.
* [NEW] The hybrid SDK also supports the new version variable types. For more information see <a href="/dev/js/hybrid-sdk-reference-guide/#setversionvalue">Setting Version Variable Valuse with the Hybrid SDK</a>.
* [TESTED] The Artisan Android SDK has been tested against the Android M preview and there are no known issues at this time.
