# iOS 2.4.3 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [NEW] New support for PII filtering of Artisan analytics. If your application needs to filter PII (personally identifiable information) at the application level to prevent transmission of sensitive information to Artisan, you can set list of regular expressions for data that needs to be redacted. For more information see <a href="/dev/ios/advanced-config/#pii-filters">Advanced Configuration</a>.
* [NEW] Added automatic logging of app crashes. Artisan will record crash information including the exception and send that information back to Artisan the next time the app starts. These crash events will be available in your Events report on Artisan Tools and can be used for segmenting and personalizing your app experience just like any other event. For more information see <a href="/dev/ios/event-tracking/#crashes">Automatic Crash Logging</a>.
* [FIXED] Fixed critical bug affecting iOS 8.0 devices related to device rotation that was introduced in Artisan 2.4.2. It is critical that you upgrade to this version if you are using Artisan SDK 2.4.2.

## Known Issues in this Version

* Artisan push opened events are not being recorded as they should, leading to underreporting of push interactions. This issue is fixed in Artisan 2.4.5.
