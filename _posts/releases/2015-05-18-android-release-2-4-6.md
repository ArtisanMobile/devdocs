# Android 2.4.6 Release Notes

Released May 18, 2015

* [UPDATED] Dramatically improved our ability to enable and disable Artisan functionality remotely.
* [UPDATED] We no longer require WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE. Please remove this from your Application Manifest if your app doesn't require it for some other reason.
* [UPDATED] Improved javadoc for much of our public API from power hooks, in code experiments and user profiles. The docs now correctly link to the ArtisanRegisteredApplication methods where registration should happen.
