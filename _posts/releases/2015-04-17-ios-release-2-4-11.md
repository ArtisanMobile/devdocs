# iOS 2.4.11 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [NEW] Artisan Crash reporting will now also collect crash events for signal events like SIGABRT, SIGILL, SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGBUS and SIGPIPE. This will not interfere with any existing signal handlers that you have in your application or from other libraries that you may be using.
* [UPDATED] The appledocs have been updated to include the UIView and UICollectionView artisanNameTag properties, added via category. For more information see <a href="/dev/ios/event-tracking/#nameviewcontroller">Naming View Controllers and Views</a>.
* [FIXED] The <a href="/dev/ios/callbacks/#power-hook">Artisan Power Hook Variable</a> api has been fixed to return the correct value for the valueAsFloat method. There is also a new method valueAsDouble for your large numbers.
