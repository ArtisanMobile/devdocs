# iOS 2.4.9 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

This release introduces additional configurations related to Artisan's collection of UITableView and UICollectionView analytics.

* [UPDATED] Added additional configurations to remove Artisan auto-proxying of the UITableView and UICollectionView `setDataSource:` method.  See <a href="/dev/ios/event-tracking/#table-and-collection-view">UITableView and UICollectionView Event Tracking</a> for more details.
* [REMOVED] Two methods were removed from ARManager logMessage and setLogMessageUserId. These were part of an old logging feature that is no longer supported.

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Because of an issue identified in the Artisan iOS SDK related to the 'Switch Control' Accessibility Feature in iOS 8.1 and 8.2, we recommend that all users use or upgrade to iOS SDK v2.4.10 or greater.</p>
