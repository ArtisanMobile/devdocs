# iOS 2.4.9 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [UPDATED] The Artisan Power Hook API has been updated with tighter validation on Power Hook Varaibles and Blocks: default value and default data parameters cannot be nil and the hook id and friendly name may not be blank.
* [REMOVED] Two methods were removed from ARManager logMessage and setLogMessageUserId. These were part of an old logging feature that is no longer supported.
