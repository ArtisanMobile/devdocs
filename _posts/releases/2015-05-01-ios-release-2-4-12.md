# iOS 2.4.12 Release Notes

Released May 1, 2015

* [UPDATED] Dramatically improved our ability to enable and disable Artisan functionality remotely, including making live updates to the Artisan Blacklist and Disabled Classes configuration.
* [FIXED] Fixed Artisan Crash reporting so that when other crash reporting libraries are present Artisan is still able to record events. We should now work seamlessly next to other crash reporting libraries.
* [UPDATED] Removed duplicate screen view events for UIAlertViews.
* [FIXED] Fixed issue where UIViewController name tags were not being respected for cell selection events for table views and collection views. If you were using <a href="/dev/ios/event-tracking/#nameviewcontroller">UIViewController name tags</a> and have table or collection views on the screen with previous versions of the iOS SDK please contact <a href="mailto:support@useartisan.com?Subject=UIViewController%20NameTag%20and%20Analytics" target="_top">support@useartisan.com</a> for help with transitioning.
