# iOS 2.4.15 Release Notes

Released June 17, 2015

* [NEW] There's a new version variable type for Artisan user profiles. Versions are useful for tracking numeric values like api versions or app versions (2.4.8 or 2.5-RELEASE, for example). Artisan automatically collects your app's current version as a profile variable, but if you have any other version that would be useful for segmenting your user base for analytic purposes or targeting changes to your app, see these new API methods. For more information see <a href="/dev/ios/user-profiles/#register">Registering Custom User Profile Variables</a>.
* [UPDATED] This version of the Artisan iOS SDK has been tested against iOS 9 Beta and XCode 7. This release includes a fix to a critical issue related to the application delegate that prevented apps from loading properly in this beta version of the OS. There is a known issue with networking as of this Artisan release that we will be monitoring and updating as updates to iOS 9 and XCode 7 are released. These issues are not present in previous versions of iOS or XCode.
