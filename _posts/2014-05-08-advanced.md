## Configure the Analytics Dispatch Period

For some apps it makes sense to dial back the frequency of the Artisan Analytics uploads.

By default analytics are uploaded every 60 seconds as long as the device is online. If you have long-running sessions and are concerned about battery drain due to frequent use of the antenna, you can control how often Artisan sends Analytics to the Artisan Servers.

In your Application onCreate you can create an ArtisanConfigOption object and set the desired dispatch period. Note: this value is in seconds.

{% highlight java %}
@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();

  // dispatch only every 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  ArtisanConfigOption config = new ArtisanConfigOption();
  config.setAnalyticsDispatchPeriod(300);

  ArtisanManager.startArtisan(this, "YOURAPPIDHERE", config);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note note-important">
  <p>This method is only available on Artisan 2.2.6 and above. If you are using an older version of Artisan and can't upgrade and you need to configure the dispatch rate please contact us.</p>
</div>

<div class="note note-hint">
  <p>In order to cap disk usage while offline or between analytics uploads, we will only store up to 1024 analytics events on the device. If that number is exceeded we will start deleting the oldest events, which means that you will lose data about your user's engagement with your app. For that reason, try to keep your dispatch period short enough that your users will generate fewer than 1024 analytics events (page views, taps, etc) on average.</p>
</div>

## Disable the Artisan Gesture

Normally, the Artisan Gesture can only be made when an Artisan user is logged in to Artisan Tools and the "Connect your Device" message is visible.

Nonetheless, some app developers would prefer not to allow the Artisan Gesture in production builds to avoid any possibility of end users triggering the Artisan Gesture toast message. Removing the gesture can also eliminate rare conflicts between the Artisan Gesture Listener and the app's own gesture and touch handling.

### In Production

For your production builds you can use **ArtisanManager.disableGesture()** to prevent the Artisan Gesture Overlay from being added to your Activities, which will prevent you from making the Artisan Gesture.

You should all this method before startArtisan in the onCreate of your Application class, like this:

{% highlight java %}
@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();

  ArtisanManager.disableGesture();

  ArtisanManager.startArtisan(this, "YOURAPPIDHERE");
}
{% endhighlight %}


<div class="note note-hint">
  <p>IMPORTANT: This is safe to use in production, but know that you will not be able to connect with Artisan Tools from a build of your app that has this flag turned on. See below for an alternative for non-production builds.</p>
</div>

### In Non-Production Builds

Even if you don't want to enable the Artisan Gesture, you may still need to connect to Artisan Tools from time to time. For that purpose there is another method: **ArtisanManager.disableGestureAndShowLoginOnForeground()**.

This will still prevent the Artisan Gesture Overlay from being added to your Activities, but it will check if you are currently looking at a "Connect your Device" screen in Artisan Tools and prompt you to enter your username and password right after you foreground if you are.

You should all this method before startArtisan in the onCreate of your Application class, like this:

{% highlight java %}
@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();

  ArtisanManager.disableGestureAndShowLoginOnForeground();

  ArtisanManager.startArtisan(this, "YOURAPPIDHERE");
}
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note note-important">
  <p>IMPORTANT: Don't include this in your production code!! If you do, your app users could see the login box on foreground if you have the Artisan connect your device screen up on your browser.</p>
</div>

## Disable Artisan Push

By default the Artisan installer is going to enable [Artisan Push]({% post_url 2014-05-08-push-notifications %}). If you don't wish to use Artisan Push and you haven't installed yet you can simply install with the --nopush flag like this:

{% highlight bash %}
install.sh --nopush  # on Mac or Linux
install.bat --nopush  # on Windows
{% endhighlight %}

If you have already installed Artisan with Artisan Push and you would like to remove it you only need to edit your AndroidManifest.xml and Application class.

### In your AndroidManifest.xml

1\. Remove the ArtisanPushReceiver and the ArtisanPushService from your manifest:

{% highlight xml %}
<receiver android:name="com.artisan.push.ArtisanPushReceiver"
    android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND" >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" />

        <category android:name="YOUR.APP.PACKAGE" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
<service android:name="com.artisan.push.ArtisanPushService" />
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note note-important">
<p>Keep <strong>&lt;service android:name="com.artisan.services.ArtisanService" /&gt;</strong> --That’s what enables Artisan to work with your app.</p>
</div>

2\. Also, if you weren't using Google Cloud Messaging before you installed Artisan you may want to remove these permissions that might have been added by the Artisan Installer.

{% highlight xml %}
<permission android:name=“YOUR.APP.PACKAGE.permission.C2D_MESSAGE" android:protectionLevel="signature"/>
<uses-permission android:name=“YOUR.APP.PACKAGE.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE"/>

<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version" android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note note-hint">
  <p>If you aren't sure whether these permissions were added by Artisan or not it may be safer to leave them. Check with source control or ask your developers.</p>
</div>

### In your Application class

In your Application onCreate method remove the call to **ArtisanManager.setPushSenderId("YOUR_GCM_SENDER_ID")** if it is there.

{% highlight java %}
// REMOVE THIS if it is present
ArtisanManager.setPushSenderId("000012345670000");  
{% endhighlight %}

You can also add **ArtisanManager.disableArtisanPush()** to your Application’s onCreate method if you want to be extra explicit.

{% highlight java %}
import com.artisan.application.ArtisanApplication;
import com.artisan.manager.ArtisanManager;

public class ArtisanDemoApplication extends ArtisanApplication {

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    // Explicitly disable Artisan Push
    ArtisanManager.disableArtisanPush();

    ArtisanManager.startArtisan(this, "YOUR_ARTISAN_APP_ID");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note note-hint">
  <p>It isn't required that you explicitly disable Artisan Push. It won't be enabled if you have not provided your Push Sender Id and configured your Application Manifest to add the Artisan Push receiver, service, and permissions.</p>
</div>
