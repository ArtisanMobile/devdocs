# Advanced Configuration for the Artisan Android SDK

## Disabling the Artisan Gesture

Normally, the Artisan Gesture can only be made when an Artisan user is logged in to Artisan Tools and the "Connect your Device" message is visible.

Nonetheless, some app developers would prefer not to allow the Artisan Gesture in production builds to avoid any possibility of end users triggering the Artisan Gesture toast message. Removing the gesture can also eliminate rare conflicts between the Artisan Gesture Listener and the app's own gesture and touch handling.

### In Production

For your production builds you can use **ArtisanManager.disableGesture()** to prevent the Artisan Gesture Overlay from being added to your Activities, which will prevent you from making the Artisan Gesture.

You should all this method before startArtisan in the onCreate of your Application class, like this:

{% highlight java %}
@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();

  ArtisanManager.disableGesture();

  ArtisanManager.startArtisan(this, "YOURAPPIDHERE";
}
{% endhighlight %}


<div class="note note-hint">
  <p>IMPORTANT: This is safe to use in production, but know that you will not be able to connect with Artisan Tools from a build of your app that has this flag turned on. See below for an alternative for non-production builds.</p>
</div>

### In Non-Production Builds

Even if you don't want to enable the Artisan Gesture, you may still need to connect to Artisan Tools from time to time. For that purpose there is another method: **ArtisanManager.disableGestureAndShowLoginOnForeground()**.

This will still prevent the Artisan Gesture Overlay from being added to your Activities, but it will check if you are currently looking at a "Connect your Device" screen in Artisan Tools and prompt you to enter your username and password right after you foreground if you are.

You should all this method before startArtisan in the onCreate of your Application class, like this:

{% highlight java %}
@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();

  ArtisanManager.disableGestureAndShowLoginOnForeground();

  ArtisanManager.startArtisan(this, "YOURAPPIDHERE";
}
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note note-important">
  <p>IMPORTANT: Don't include this in your production code!! If you do, your app users could see the login box on foreground if you have the Artisan connect your device screen up on your browser.</p>
</div>
