# iOS 2.4.0 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [UPDATED] Updates to support Artisan JS SDK 2.1 including auto-instrumentation for dynamic web elements.

## Known Issues in this Version

* When connected to Artisan and discovering analytics events by interacting with the app, Purchase workflow events are being sent over with the incorrect type, which means they will not match up with events sent normally to Artisan for the purposes of reporting and goals. The SDK was updated in this release to send page view and purchase events across to Artisan Tools when connected to Artisan. Previously only user interactions and custom events were sent over for event discovery.
