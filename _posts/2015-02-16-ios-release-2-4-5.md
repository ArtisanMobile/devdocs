# iOS 2.4.5 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [FIXED] This release fixes a critical issue with analytics for Artisan Push messaging. Since the Artisan 2.3.11 release Push messages were not triggering an analytics event for push opened, leading to underreporting of push interactions.
