# iOS 2.4.8 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [NEW] New API for accessing details about currently running Artisan Power Hook Experiments. For more information see <a href="/dev/ios/power-hooks/#experiment-details">Power Hook Experiment Details</a>.
* [FIXED] Fixed bug that caused Artisan In-App message actions to not be triggered after a quick background and foreground.
* [UPDATED] With the addition of new Power Hook Experiment details we updated the existing ARInCodeExperimentDetails models to make them consistent with the naming in ARExperimentDetails. The following properties on ARInCodeExperimentDetails were renamed:
   * **defaultVariation** is now **defaultVariant**
   * **currentVariationId** is now **currentVariantId**
   * **currentVariationName** is now **currentVariantName**
