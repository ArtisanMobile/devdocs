#iOS SDK 2.2.8 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

This release provides updates to our public API related to getting details about the currently running experiments.

* [UPDATE] We have modified our API to provide more information about running Artisan Experiments. See <a href="/dev/ios/incode-experiments/#advanced">Advanced Experiment Analytics</a>. NOTE: The return type of this method has changed, we now return an NSArray of ARExperimentDetails objects instead of a NSDictionary and we now include **all** experiments and not just in-code experiments.
