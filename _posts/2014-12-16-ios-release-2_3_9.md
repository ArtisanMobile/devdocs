# iOS SDK 2.3.9 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [FIXED] Fixed critical bug for apps that are using [Pixate Freestyle for iOS](https://github.com/Pixate/pixate-freestyle-ios). Screens with UITableViews or UICollectionViews were causing app crashes due to interaction between our two frameworks.
