#Canvas

##Getting Started
With Canvas, you can make realtime changes to the screen design (user interface) of your application on the fly. Perhaps there\'s a typo that needs to be fixed. Maybe there\'s a color you don\'t like. Instantly publish those changes without having to resubmit to the app store. Not sure which screen design will perform better? You can always A/B test the change you just made in Canvas with Optimize.

##Overview

Aptly named, Canvas is the drawing board of Artisan. From the App Map, you can select a specific screen to work on; perhaps you would like to add an experiment on that screen. This will open up the Canvas, where you can make changes to the screen you chose. Once on Canvas, you can make any UI and design changes to the screen; it\'s here that you will be creating the variations that you push out in your A/B tests, or the specific designs you will be sending out to the segments you have created.

With Canvas, you have an interface to make changes and add to your app (images, text, buttons) after you have submitted to the app store. Canvas also allows you to preview these changes before they go to any devices. This means you can make real time improvements to your app, all without code. Simply drag and drop the elements that you\'d like to send out to your users (or more specifically, your segments) and publish; your users will receive the designs right away.

###What is the Canvas?

We make changes to a screen for A/B testing, personalizing and adding tags through the Artisan Canvas, it is our interface.

When you select Modify and Personalize, Create an Experiment or Add a Tag you are brought to Canvas and will be on the current screen you had selected when in App Map.

Canvas allows you to select specific elements in your app and make them available for point and click changes.

###Getting to know Canvas

In the upper left hand corner you name either your segments for Personalization or variations for A/B testing in Optimize.

In the lower left hand corner, you will see the UI elements from within your app - you can click on the name of the element to select it in the list or you can click/press on the element within the screen depicted.

The center of the screen is a snapshot of your app that you can directly interact with to select, move or change the size of an element.

The right hand side of the screen provides you the controls to add text, images, paragraphs or buttons as well as the ability to make changes and optimizations to existing elements.
