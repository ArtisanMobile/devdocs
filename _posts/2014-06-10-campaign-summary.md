# Viewing Campaign Results
After you've started your campaign and your users have started interacting with your app your campaign results will start to populate. You can reach your campaign results at any time by clicking on the name of your campaign from the Campaigns page.

The campaign summary screen contains lots of valuable information about how your campaign is performing.

## Key Performance Indicators

* **Messages Sent** -- Total number of push messages sent to your users during the campaign
* **Open Rate** -- The Open Rate lets you know what percentage of your users actually opened your push notification
* **Audience Size** -- This is the number of people who are currently active in your campaign

## Push Notification Open Time
Push Notification Open Time is a scatter-plot style chart that shows you the days and times your users opened your push notification. Understanding when your users open your push notifications will help you discover the best time to send push notifications to maximize engagement with your users.

## Sessions & Session Length
The Sessions and Session Length charts display the number of sessions and the length of time your users used your app both during your campaign and before your campaign start date.

The blue dotted line represents the start of your campaign. We show you a short period of time, relative to the length of your campaign, before your campaign start date so you can determine wether or not sessions and session length increased or decreased during your campaign.
