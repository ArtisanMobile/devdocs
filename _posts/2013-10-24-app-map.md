#App Map

App Map is the interface between your application and Artisan. It is essentially a projection of all the screens that make up your app. Details for each screen are provided on the Action Sheet, located on the right side of the screen - such active experiments. Available actions that you can take such as creating an experiment or modifying your app are also displayed on the Action Sheet.

App Map allows you to navigate through the Artisan platform easily and quickly, allowing you to spend more time optimizing your user\'s mobile experience.

##Getting Started with App Map

After connecting your app to the Artisan Platform, you will be automatically be brought to the App Map.

By navigating through the app on either your phone or simulator (not directly on the webpage) you will notice how the screens change - this is how you\'re able to easily select the screen you would like to work on.

On the right hand side of the screen you will be presented with the opportunities to do the following:

* Modify and Personalize
* Create a new experiment
* Configure an in-code experiment
* Add a tag
* You will receive helpful notifications such as \"There are active personalizations or experiments running this screen.\"
