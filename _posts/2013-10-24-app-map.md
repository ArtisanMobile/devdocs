# Design Center
Navigate through your app and select screens on which you would like to take actions. 

## Getting Started with App Map
App Map is the primary method used to navigate through your app using Artisan. It is essentially a projection of all the screens that make up your app. 

By navigating through your app — on either your device or simulator — you will notice how the screens change on the App Map. This is how you're able to easily select the screen you would like to work on.

As you navigate, details for each screen (such as active experiments) are provided on the Action Sheet, located on the right side of the screen. From the Action Sheet, you can do the following:

* Modify the screen
* Personalize the screen
* Create a new experiment
* Configure an in-code experiment
* Add a tag

The Action Sheet also displays helpful information for the screen, such as active experiments and whether the screen is currently being edited by another user.
