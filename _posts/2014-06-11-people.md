# People

The People section of the Artisan platform is where you create and manage segmented Lists of users. Segmenting your users into Lists allows you to personalize experiences, send push notifications to certain users, target experiments to users, and more.

## Creating a New List

You can create a new list by clicking on the **New Segment** button located on the **People** page.

To start, give your list a name. This name is for your internal purposes and won't be seen by your users.

Users can be segmented based on geographic location, behavorial events, demographic information, user profile attributes, and your custom user attributes (see custom user profile attributes for [iOS](/dev/ios/user-profiles/) and [Android](/dev/android/user-profiles/). 

The current list of attributes is:

* **Age**
* **API Level**
* **App Build Number**
* **App Version**
* **Device Type**
* **Event**
* **Gender**
* **Geo-Coordinate**
* **Hardware Type**
* **Language**
* **OS Type**
* **OS Version**
* **Push Enabled**
* **Session Count**

Select a list rule from the dropdown and provide the required value(s) to begin creating your list. You can add as many rules as you need to create your list.

### Behavioral Events

Behavioral rules allow you to segment your users based on the activities that they have performed in your app. Behavioral rules can be created using:

* The number of times a user has performed the selected action (ex. more than, less than, exactly)
* In the last *X* days
* Between, before, or after a date

To add a behavioral rule select the **Event** item from the dropdown list. Next you need to let us know which event you would like to add to your rule. You can select your event by clicking on the **User Action** field. Finish setting up your rule by telling us how many times this event was performed and in what time period.
