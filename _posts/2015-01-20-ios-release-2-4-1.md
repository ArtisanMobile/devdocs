# iOS 2.4.1 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [NEW] Added a new API method **[ARTrackingManager getArtisanEventTagsForActiveViewControllers]** to provide access to the ArtisanEventTags for all of the currently visible View Controllers. That way the same context can be added to your custom trackEvent calls that Artisan automatically provides for all automatically-collected analytics events. For more information see the <a href="/dev/ios/event-tracking/#get-artisan-event-tags">event tracking</a> documentation.
* [FIXED] Events now send the proper event type when connected to Artisan for discovery purposes.
* [FIXED] Update to ensure the green border that displays when an app is connected to the Design Center disappears upon logout from Artisan.
