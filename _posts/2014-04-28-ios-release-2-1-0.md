#2.1.0 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date }}

This release added the ability to preview your Power Hook changes in real-time for iOS apps. We also added iOS callbacks for when Power Hook values change, to enable code to be fired on the fly when new values are published from artisantools.com.

* [NEW] The ability to preview Power Hooks before publishing for iOS.
* [NEW] iOS Callbacks in the SDK API to trigger code blocks when new Power Hook values are received by the app.
* [UPDATED] iOS and Android documentation
* [FIX] Fix to ensure that session attributes are included in analytics tracers (to ensure Device Type, OS Version, Langague et al can be used to segment users)
