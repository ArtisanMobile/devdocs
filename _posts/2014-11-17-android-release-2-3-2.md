Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [NEW] Added two-factor authentication support for users with two-factor authentication enabled on artisantools.com. For more information on enabling two-factor authentication see the <a href="/user-guide/getting-around#two-factor-authentication">User Guide to Account Settings</a>.
* [FIXED] Updated the artisan_library.jar to address dex conflicts for apps that are also using Apache httpmime. Now all artifacts are now fully obfuscated.
