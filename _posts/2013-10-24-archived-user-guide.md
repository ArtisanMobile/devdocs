##About the Artisan MEM Platform

Artisan is the industry\'s first mobile experience management (MEM) platform that allows businesses to analyze, manage and enhance their existing mobile applications in real-time without writing code or resubmitting to app stores. Customers can analyze user behavior and activity, test the effectiveness of different app designs, create personalized user experiences, and instantly publish changes directly to their users.  The result is a powerful platform that transforms static mobile apps into highly effective marketing channels that drive real business results.

## Getting Around the Artisan Platform

The Artisan platform is made up of multiple products and features. Which features you have avialable depend on your subscription. If you are unsure of your subscription, please contact our Support team. The black bar on the left side of the screen is your main point of navigation around the app. Clicking the icons on the menu will take you to that product or feature. Clicking your app icon, located above the navigation items, will take you back to your list of apps.
