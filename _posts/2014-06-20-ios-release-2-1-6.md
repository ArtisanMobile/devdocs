#2.1.6 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date }}

Small tweak to help support device whitelisting (to cut down on the number of times the Artisan Gesture needs to be performed)

* [UPDATED] Added ARStoreKitTracker 'productsRequest' API method to kick-off automatic tracking of a specific in-app transaction workflow.
* [UPDATED] Removed up-front class scanning for automatically detecting StoreKit-based transaction delegates. These are now opt-in via the ARStoreKitTracker API.
* [UPDATED] Added device name to set of information passed over when connecting an app to artisantools.com (to use for device whitelisting purposes)
* [UPDATED] API documentation.
* [UPDATED] Tweaked logging messages when the Artisan SDK cannot reach the Artisan analytics or playlist services.
* [REMOVED] Removed ArtisanEmailTracker API.
