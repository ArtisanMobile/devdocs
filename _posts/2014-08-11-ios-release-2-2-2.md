#iOS SDK 2.2.2 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [FIXED] Fixed typo in ArtisanPurchaseWorkflowManager methods--replacing "Quanity" with "Quantity." If your app is leveraging the Artisan Purchase Workflow API please correct this typo when you upgrade to Artisan 2.2.2+. There is no functional change, just the public API method signature is different.
