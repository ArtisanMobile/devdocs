#iOS SDK 2.3.7 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [FIXED] Addressing archive validation error introduced by Apple's most recent update to the App Store validation and submission process.  All Artisan SDKs prior to this fix will provoke the following error upon app archive validation:

    ```
Invalid Segment Alignment - The app binary at '<your app>/ArtisanSDK.bundle/ArtisanSDK' does not have proper segment alignment. Try rebuilding the app with the latest Xcode version.
    ```

    This fix addresses the above issue.  

    **All submitted iOS apps should use Artisan 2.3.7 or later.**
