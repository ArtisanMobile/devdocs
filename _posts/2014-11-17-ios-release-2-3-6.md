#iOS SDK 2.3.6 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

* [UPDATED PUBLIC API] The API for automated Artisan deep links and deep link analytics has changed. You can now pass categories, sub-categories and sub-sub categories along with your other URL parameters and they will be included as tags on the corresponding Artisan analytics event. For details see <a href="/dev/ios/deep-links">Deep Linking with Artisan</a>.
* [NEW] Improved collection of information about the Artisan location analytics including geolocation source and granularity. In the future you can leverage this information for advanced segmentation, personalization, and location-based marketing.
* [FIXED] Fixed displaying Artisan Campaign Takeover Messages when the device is face up. This issue affected only iOS 8 devices that were perfectly flat when the takeover message was triggered.
* [FIXED] Minor fixes and improvements to the Artisan login modal. This is only visible to users attempting to connect a device to Artisan.
