# Settings

## Getting Started

Each Artisan app has a settings screen to manage the details of your app.  Functionality available through the settings screen includes:

* Renaming and deleting your app.
* Deactivating Artisan for your app.
* Downloading the latest version of the Artisan SDK.
* Exporting event and profile data.
* Setting up push notifications.

Additionally, if you are an administrator for your Artisan Organization, you also have access to the Artisan Organization administration panel.  This panel includes:

* Your account usage statistics
* Managing users for your organization.
* Enabling / disabling two-factor authentication for your app.

## Managing Your App

To manage an app created within Artisan, click the 'App Settings' link in the Artisan top-navigation bar.

To get started, click the new campaign button on the Campaigns page.

### Renaming Your App

To rename your app, click in the 'Name' text field, type in the new name, and click 'Save Changes'.  The new name will immediately be used in artisantools.com.  This name is only used within the Artisan Control Panel, and is not exposed to any of your app users.

### Deactivating Your App

To deactivate your app, check the 'Deactivate' box and click 'Save Changes'.  Deactivating your app in this manner means the following:

* Users will cease sending any event analytics.
* Users will cease to participate in any active experiments.
* Users will cease to see any published experiment variations.
* Users will cease to see any active in-app campaigns.
* All push notification campaigns will cease sending push notifications.
* All Power Hook values will revert to their default value, as defined in code.
* All In-Code tests will revert to the control value, as defined in code.

For your app users, deactivating the app in Artisan means they will experience the app exactly as they would if Artisan had never been used.

Once deactivated, you can reactivate your app by checking the 'Activate' button and clicking 'Save Changes'.  Upon activation, your app will resume operating exactly as it did prior to being deactivated for all users.

### Downloading the Artisan SDK

The App Settings screen keeps track of which version of Artisan was present the last time you connected your app to Artisan.

If a newer version of Artisan is present, click the 'Download Artisan SDK' button and the newest version of the SDK will be downloaded automatically.

## Exporting Data

The Artisan App Settings screen allows you to do a raw, CSV export of all of the data Artisan has collected from your app users.  This includes the following content:

* All analytics events Artisan has ever seen, including all metadata about the user at the time of the event and all tagged information.
* All users Artisan has ever seen, including their most recently transmitted profile information.

### Event Data

Event data can be exported over any time range according to any of the following five filters:

* **All Events:** Every event Artisan has collected for this app.
* **Interactions Events:** Only the automatically collected events where a user interacted with elements on the screen (buttons, fields, etc.).
* **Session Starts/Stops:** Only the automatically collected 'App Started' and 'App Stopped' events.
* **Screen Views Only:** Only the automatically collected events where a user has viewed a particular screen.
* **Custom Actions Only:** Only custom events coded directly into the app.

When you click the 'Export Event Data', Artisan will start retrieving the data in its data warehouse.  Within the next 24 hours, you will receive an email (sent to the email address associated with your artisantools.com account) that contains a link to your exported data.  This link will be valid for seven days.

Contained at this link is a collection of compressed CSV files -- one for each day requested -- containing all of the raw event data.  Download this file and parse it for whatever data analysis you want to perform on the Artisan event content.

### Profile Data

When you click the 'Export Profile Data' button, Artisan will export a CSV containing all profile information we have ever collected for the users of this app.  Each row in the CSV will correspond to a single user profile, and will contain the most recent information stored in the user profile (as automatically collected by Artisan or specified via the Aritsan Profile API).

Upon clicking 'Export Profile Data', you will receive an email (sent to the email address associated with your artisantools.com account) that contains a link to your exported data.  This email should arrive within 24 hours, and the link will be valid for seven days.

## Configuring Push Messaging

The Artisan App Settings screen is the primary location to configure Aritsan to send push notifications.  Follow the instructions specified in the [iOS]({% post_url ios/2014-05-09-push-notifications %}) or [Android]({% post_url android/2014-05-08-push-notifications %}) to get Artisan configured to send Push Notifications in your app.
