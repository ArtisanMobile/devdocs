# Settings

## Getting Started

Each Artisan app has a settings screen to manage the details of your app.  Functionality available through the settings screen includes:

* Renaming and deleting your app.
* Downloading the latest version of the Artisan SDK.
* Exporting event and profile data.
* Setting up push notifications.

## Managing Your App

To manage an app created within Artisan, click the 'App Settings' link in the Artisan top-navigation bar.

To get started, click the new campaign button on the Campaigns page.

### Renaming Your App

To rename your app, click in the 'Name' text field, type in the new name, and click 'Save Changes'.  The new name will immediately be used in artisantools.com.  This name is only used within the Artisan Control Panel, and is not exposed to any of your app users.

### Deleting Your App

To delete your app from Artisan, click the 'Delete App' button in the top-right corner.  Once deleted, the following conditions will hold true:

* Users will cease sending any event analytics.
* Users will cease to participate in any active experiments.
* Users will cease to see any published experiment variations.
* Users will cease to see any active in-app campaigns.
* All push notification campaigns will cease sending push notifications.
* All Power Hook values will revert to their default value, as defined in code.
* All In-Code tests will revert to the control value, as defined in code.

Users will experience your app as if Artisan had never been installed.

### Downloading the Artisan SDK

The App Settings screen keeps track of which version of Artisan was present the last time you connected your app to Artisan.
