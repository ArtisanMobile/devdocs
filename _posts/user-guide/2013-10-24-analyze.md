# Reports & Analytics
Collect all usage information about your app, and organize the data into the reports that matter to you.

## Getting Started
There are a few ways to start gaining deeper insights into your app with Artisan:

* You can simply let Artisan run and see what kind of activity is being automatically collected.
* You can create Goals to better understand how your users are progressing through your app.
* You can create tags to associate specific pieces of content with user behavior.

## Reports
Artisan reports give you valuable insight into how your app is performing. Each report gives you insight into different areas. The current available reports are:

* Users
* Sessions
* Devices
* Operating Systems
* Recency
* Frequency
* Events
* Retention

Report data can be filtered across a number of different criteria, including:

* User Segment (see [People & Segmentation]({% post_url user-guide/2014-06-11-people %}))
* Date Range
* Device Chararacteristics, including:
    * OS Version
    * App Version
    * Device Model
    * Device Language
    * User Country
* User Experiment Variation (for users who have participated in an A/B Test, see [Experiments]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-optimize %}))
* User Campaign (for users who had been engaged in a campaign, see [Campaigns]({% post_url user-guide/2014-06-10-campaigns %}))

The Event Report includes additional filters to provide additional insight into event-level data:

* Event Tag Values
* Event Category Values

The event-specific filters enable event data to be sorted and viewed based off of the attached tag data, which itself can be organized into a hierarchy via tag families.

### Users
The Users Report provides an understanding of new vs. existing users, along with a range of recurring user statistics (e.g. unique users from yesterday). Note that users in this case are in fact unique users over the specified timespan.

### Sessions
The Sessions Report indicates session trends for the number of sessions and average session length, computed either daily or over a specified period of time. Note that a session is the determined as a single instance where a user started and then closed the app, and session time is determined from the time from app opens to when it is closed or backgrounded on the device.

### Devices
The Devices Report demonstrates the number of sessions per device type both in a trend line as well as daily.

### Operating Systems
The Operating Systems Report displays the operating system version for the devices that your app is installed on both in a trend line as well as daily.

### Recency

The Recency Report graphs how long it had been since your users had previously used your app prior to them using it during the specified time frame.  This is intended to show how long users are going between usages of your app, and whether you've seen a spike in loyal users (i.e. users who use the app repeatedly on the same day) or long-time dormant users (i.e. users who hadn't used the app for weeks before returning).

For example, if you're viewing the report for the 'Last 30 Days' time frame:

* If a user who had last used your app three months ago uses it again yesterday, their new session will be tallied in the '60+ days' column.
* If a new user freshly downloads your app 20 days ago and then uses it for the first time, their first session will be tallied in the 'New User' column.
* If that same user then uses the app again 10 days ago, their second session will be tallied in the '8-14 days' column.

### Frequency

The Frequency Report shows the number of times your users had ever previously used your app prior to them using it during the specified time frame.  This is intended to show what percentage of your users during that time frame were extremely loyal users (i.e. had used your app dozens of times already) versus what percentage were new or new-ish users who had only used the app a few times.

For example, if you're viewing the report for the 'Last 30 Days' time frame:

* If a user freshly downloads your app 15 days ago and uses your app for the first time, that session is their first ever session and will be tallied in the '1st' column.
* If that same user then uses the app again 10 days ago, that second session will be their second ever session, and will be tallied in the '2nd' column.
* If a long-time user who had already used your app 23 times uses it for the 24th time ten days ago, that session will be tallied in the '21st-25th' column.

### Events

The Event Report provides visibility into the actions triggered by users within your app (e.g. screens viewed, buttons tapped, events instrumented via the [iOS]({% post_url ios/2014-05-09-event-tracking %}), [Android]({% post_url android/2014-05-08-event-tracking %}) or [Javascript]({% post_url js/2014-07-18-hybrid-sdk-reference-guide %}#trackingapi) Event Tracking APIs, etc.).

#### What Artisan Collects

Artisan automatically collects all key information about how your app is being used by all of your current users. Events that are automatically collected include:

* Screen Views
* Button Taps
* Segmented Control Taps
* Table Cell Selections
* Session Start and Completion

Events and their names are inferred automatically from your app.  All events are not user-specific; no personal information is collected and analytics queries are made in aggregate.

Additionally, events can be manually collected via the [Artisan Event Tracking API]({% post_url android/2014-05-08-event-tracking %}). This API is available for capturing events triggered within the business logic of your app or events not automatically collected by Artisan.

#### The Artisan Event Library

The left side of the screen shows your current event library.  You can add items to the event library by clicking the `Discover` button in the top-left corner of the screen.  This will open up the Event Discovery modal, where you can (a) select new events from the complete list of actions Artisan has automatically tracked, or (b) connect your device directly to Artisan to find the events you want to add to your library.

<p><img src="/images/screens/reports-discover-example-700x420.gif" width="700" height="420" alt="Screen capture of a sample event report discovery." /></p>

Selecting an event from the event library will produce a report on how many times that event has occurred as well as how many times that event has occurred per user.

#### Context Tags

This API can also add context tags and categories to the information that Artisan tracks.  These tags and categories can be used to filter the event report, as well as to see a breakdown of how often a given tagged event occurs in the wild.

For example, an 'Place Takeout Order' event can be tagged with the StoreID where the user placed their order, as well as the CouponID they used when they made the order.  This will allow you to see the breakdown of which coupons users have used in the app, as well as which stores they've placed orders from.  

You can then arrange these two tagged values into a Tagged Family, which will allow you to see exactly how often each coupon was redeemed from each store:

<p><img src="/images/screens/reports-tag-family-450x417.png" width="450" height="417" alt="Screen capture of how to create tagged families." /></p>

<p><img src="/images/screens/reports-filter-700x485.png" width="700" height="480" alt="Screen capture of a user changing the dates on a report." /></p>

### Retention

The Retention Report allows for your users to be divided into cohorts -- users who triggered a specific action (i.e. logging in, making a purchase, viewing an article) on a specific day -- so that you can see what percentage of that cohort returned to perform a follow-up action at some point in the future.

For example, if you want to see how frequently users who complete an order return to make another purchase over the next few months, you can use the Retention Report to view this trend.  As illustrated:

<p><img src="/images/screens/retention-report-example-700x480.gif" width="700" height="480" alt="Screen capture of a user building an example Retention Report." /></p>

* Select users who triggered the 'Order Complete' action to be your cohort.
* Select 'Order Complete' to be your follow-up action.

The chart will show how many users triggered the 'Order Complete' action each day, as well what percentage of those users returned to complete another order on each of the next fourteen days.

This chart can also be configured to show different date windows, and to group cohorts by weeks or months instead of days.

## Goals
Use Goals to measure the effectiveness of your app against key performance indicators (KPIs) such as funnel completion, session length, etc.

### Creating a Goal
* Click on Goals icon in the left hand sidebar
* Click New Goal (green plus sign) to create a new user funnel
* Connect your app to Artisan if prompted
* Enter the name your goal, navigate to the start of your goal within your app, and press Start Recording to begin defining your funnel
* To build your funnel, navigate through the desired screens you would like your user to traverse in an ideal scenario e.g. select product, add to cart and check out screens. Each action you trigger should automatically appear on your screen as you execute it in your app. This sequence of events will serve as the funnel that Artisan will use and report upon.
* Confirm the selected events are the events you want included in the funnel and delete any you do not want by pressing the red X alongside that event. 
* Click Stop Recording and you will automatically be redirected to the Goal Summary page. The newly created goal will be in the list of goals at the bottom of the page. The performance of the goal over the life of your app (since Artisan was installed and deployed to the app store) will automatically be calculated.

### Viewing a Goal
Artisan provides detailed analytics on each of your goals. 

To view the detail of a Goal, simply click the goal you would like to view in the list down at the bottom of the main Goals page.

The goal report is automatically populated with all of the historical data of your app, and is kept up-to-date in real time. This report data is filterable by date range, and shows the following four pieces of information about your goal:

* Overall performance across each of the funnel goal steps for the specified date range
* Table defining the number of sessions that have reached each step of the goal across the entire date range
* Historical trends of the goal conversion rate
* Historical overview of how many sessions have reached each step for each day since the beginning of the date range

### Changing a Goal
Once built, a funnel goal cannot be changed; that is, you cannot add or delete the screens that make up the funnel of your goal. If you must change the makeup of your funnel, you will need to delete the current funnel goal, and create a new one with the correct screens and interactions.

### Changing the duration
You can select the period of time that your goal is measuring. Since Artisan retroactively fits the funnel to your data, any time after the date the SDK was installed is available for viewing.

### Deleting a Goal
To delete a goal, you must be in main Goals summary page. Click the gear next to goal you’d like to change. Here you can delete the goal, or change the name of the goal.
