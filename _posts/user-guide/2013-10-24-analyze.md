# Reports & Analytics

## Getting Started
Once Artisan is installed in your app, it will automatically begin collecting data about how users (including you) are using it.

There are a few ways to start gaining deeper insights into your app with Artisan:

* You can simply let Artisan run and see what kind of activity is automatically being collected via the Artisan Analytics Reports.
* You can track additional custom events via the Artisan Event Tracking APIs.
* You can create event tags to associate specific metadata with user behavior.
* You can manage the different events Artisan is collecting via the Artisan Event Report.
* You can create Goals to better understand how your users are progressing through your app.
* You can build User Segments to analyze how different groups of users are using your app.  These segments can then be used for Marketing Campaigns and A/B Testing.

This guide describes each of the ways you can start using Artisan to discover how users are using your app and what you can do to improve their retention and lifetime value.
