# People

The People section of the Artisan platform is where you create and manage segmented Lists of users. Segmenting your users into Lists allows you to personalize experiences, send push notifications to certain users, target experiments to users, and more.

## Creating Lists & Segments

You can create a new list by clicking on the **New Segment** button located on the **People** page.

### Available Criteria

Users can be segmented based on the following properties:

* **Geographic Location**
    * Artisan will automatically collect the most recent location of all users (using Location Services if available, otherwise Geo-IP).  Segments can be built to incorporate all users who are within a radius of a certain point, per this last reported location.  Users can also be segmented based off of their reported city, country, or state (or state equivalent).

* **Device Information**
    * Artisan automatically collects OS Version, Hardware Type, Device Type (i.e. Phone vs. Tablet), and API Level (Android Only), all of which can be used to define a segment.

* **App Information**
    * Artisan automatically collects App Version and App Build Number, which can also be used to build segment criteria.

* **User Profile Information**
    * Artisan automatically collects information about the user, including the language settings on their phone, whether they have Push Notifications enabled, and how many sessions they've ever had.  Each of these can be used to define segment criteria.

    * Additionally, Artisan has access to any additional profile information that has been passed to Artisan via the Profile Manager API.  Segment criteria can be built on any this profile information, with rules specific to the type of data passed (i.e. Date, Time, Integer, Floating Point number, etc.)

* **User Behavior**
    * Artisan can segment users based off of what events they've triggered in the past.  Any event collected by Artisan is valid to use for segmentation purposes (see [Tracking Events]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-managing-events %})).  Behavioral criteria can include whether a user has triggered a specific action X number of times ever, X number of times between two dates, X number of times in the last Y days, or never.


### Building A New List

On the 'New Segment' screen, you can name your new segment and add a series of rules to define its population.  Rules are added and removed by clicking the 'X' and '+' icons on the right side of each rule. The population of the segment is defined by the users who satisfy ALL of the rules defined for the segment.

Select a list rule from the dropdown and provide the required value(s) to begin creating your list. You can add as many rules as you need to create your list.  The operators available for each rule depend on the data type.  For example, for a profile property that contains integers (like 'Session Count' or 'Age'), you can specify that the property be 'less than', 'less than or equal to', 'greater than', 'greater than or equal to', 'between', 'equal', or 'not equal'.

When you're done adding rules click Save to start using your new list.  Artisan will immediately begin determining what existing users fall within the defined segment rules, as well as all of the report data associated with the new segment.  This data will populate over the next few hours.  Meanwhile, all new users and report content for this segment will be kept up-to-date in real-time.

### Behavioral Events

Behavioral rules allow you to segment your users based on the activities that they have performed in your app. Behavioral rules can be created using:

* The number of times a user has performed the selected action (ex. more than, less than, exactly)
* In the last *X* days
* Between, before, or after a date

To add a behavioral rule select the **Event** item from the dropdown list. Next you need to let us know which event you would like to add to your rule. You can select your event by clicking on the **User Action** field. Finish setting up your rule by telling us how many times this event was performed and in what time period.
