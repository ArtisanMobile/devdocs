# Experiments
A/B test different designs to identify the variation that produces the best results.

## Understanding Your Experiment Results

Artisan uses confidence levels to explain the results of A/B Tests. A confidence level signifies the amount of certainty that the conversion rate of a variation within an experiment will beat the conversion rate of the control when published to the total population of app users.

The industry standard is to achieve a 95% confidence level. This means that there is a 95% chance that the conversion rate of the variation will be higher than that of the control when published. Artisan signals that 95% confidence has been achieved by adding a yellow/green medal to the variation on the experiment screen. For the exact confidence level, hover over the yellow/green medal or download the detailed statistics for the experiment.

A yellow medal indicates that the particular variation has a 95% confidence level that its conversion rate is better than the control. A green medal indicates that the particular variation has a 95% confidence level that its conversion rate is better than all other variations.
