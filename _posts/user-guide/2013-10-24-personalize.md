# Personalizing Your App
Identify your most important users and segment them into groups so that you can deliver unique user experiences.

## What is Personalization?
Personalization is a process that combines [segmentation]({% post_url user-guide/2014-06-11-people %}/#create-list) and [publishing]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-design-canvas %}/#instant-publishing). Once you've identified segments, publishing gives you the ability to distribute customized screen designs to those segments. Personalize enables you to target specific groups of users with custom content and designs so you can increase engagement, conversions, and create positive user experiences. 

## Getting Started
To start off with Personalize, you'll need to build a segment in the [Artisan People]({% post_url user-guide/2014-06-11-people %}/#create-list) area to which you want to publish a personalized change.  Once built, you'll want to observe the following steps:

### Personalizing Your App
* You can start personalizing your app by visiting the App Map and selecting a screen that you would like to work with
* Click on Modifications and Personalizations on the right hand side to open the design canvas
* On the "Personalizations" panel, click + to define a new segment
* You have the option to select an existing segment, or define a new one
* Under "Build a new Segment", in the drop down menu, select the distinguishing user dimension
* If you've defined User profile variables, they will be included here along with the built in dimensions
* To change the design of a personalization simply choose a segment that you would like to work with from the Personalizations panel. From there you can select items on the screen to move, resize, or change the properties of.
* Click "Publish" on the top right of the Canvas to publish your changes immediately.

### Changing a Personalization
Changing a personalization is the same as creating a personalization.

* Make changes to the items on the screen that you wish to update

### Deleting Personalization
You can delete a personalization by hovering over the name of the segment in the Personalizations panel in the Canvas and clicking the "X" icon. After you have removed your personalizations, click the Publish button to apply the changes.
