# Design Center
The Artisan Design Center is the central place to make changes to your app, including no-code UI changes via the Artisan Canvas.

Upon navigating to the Design Center, Artisan will request that you connect your device.

Once connected, you'll automatically be navigated to the Artisan App Map. The App Map tracks each screen you navigate to on your device, and displays different actions that you can take to optimize the experience of your application.

## Getting Started with App Map
As you navigate through your app — on either your device or simulator — you will notice how the screens change on the App Map. This is how you can select the screen you would like to work on with Artisan.

The currently selected screen will also be highlighted (via a green border) on the connected device.  For cases when multiple screens are visible at the same time, you can select which one you'd like to target with the App Map by tapping the Artisan Connect icon and selecting the targeted screen from the list.

As you navigate, details for each screen (such as active experiments) are provided on the Action Sheet, located on the right side of the screen. From the Action Sheet, you can do the following:

* [Modify the screen]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-design-canvas %})
* [Personalize the screen]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-personalize %})
* [Create a new Canvas experiment]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-experiments-canvas %})
* [Configure an in-code experiment]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-experiments-in-code %})

The Action Sheet also displays helpful information for the screen, such as active experiments and whether the screen is currently being edited by another user.
