# Getting Around

## Notifications
The Notification center helps you stay on top of your app's performance. Artisan will send you alerts on how your app is performing, A/B test suggestions, Goal Funnel trends, and other helpful communications. You can access the Notification Center by clicking on the Notifications icon on the menu bar.

If you have an unread message, the notification icon will be highlighted and display the number of unread messages waiting for you:

You can open you notification inbox any time by clicking on the notifications icon in menu. Your notification inbox contains read and unread items. Unread items are indicated by a bold subject name. To open a notification, click on a notification to open and read the notification details. You can close a notification by clicking the Close icon, located on the top right of the notification.

## Account Settings

The account settings screen can be accessed by hovering over the user icon to the right of the notifications icon at the top of your screen. On this page you will be able to view your organization's details and manage user access controls.
