# Reports & Analytics

## Goals
Use Goals to measure the effectiveness of your app in getting users to convert on conversion flows.  An Artisan Goal is composed of a series of events arranged into a funnel.  The events themselves can be selected from the [Aritsan Event Library]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-managing-events %}/#event-library), or built dynamically by connecting your device directly to Artisan.  Once built, Artisan will populate the historical performance for your funnel across all segments, and will keep those results up-to-date moving forward.

### Creating a Goal

#### Using the Artisan Event Library

Artisan Goals can be built by using the events Artisan has already collected to assemble the steps of the funnel you want to measure.  To build a funnel using the events Artisan already has in its Event Library, observe the following steps:

* Click on 'Goals' in the Artisan navigation bar.
* Click 'New Goal' to begin constructing a new goal.
* Click and drag events from the left sidebar into the main area to specify which events compose your conversion funnel.
* For events that do not appear on the left sidebar, use the [Artisan Discovery]({% post_url user-guide/2013-10-24-managing-events %}/#event-library) capability to explore events Artisan has already collected.
* Click and drag events within the main area to rearrange events into the order of your funnel.
* Click 'Save Goal'

Artisan will begin calculating the historical performance of your app according to the newly created funnel, and these results will appear over the next few hours.

<div class="note note-hint">
  <p>NOTE: Artisan Goals are computed on a per-session basis.  That means that a conversion between steps will be counted as long as the corresponding events happen at any point within a session (provided they happen in the correct order).  If a user triggers the first step of a funnel, performs several other actions (including the first step of the funnel again), then performs the second step of the funnel, that will still constitute a conversion for that goal for that session.</p>
</div>

#### Using the Artisan Interactive Goal Builder

Artisan Goals can also be built by connecting your app (running on either a device or simulator) directly to the artisantools.com website and walking through the path in your app that you want to measure as a funnel.  To do this, observe the following steps:

* Click on 'Goals' in the Artisan navigation bar.
* Click 'New Goal' to begin constructing a new goal.
* Click 'Turn On The Interactive Goal Builder'.
* Follow the instructions to connect your device to Artisan.
* Once your device is connected, each event you trigger in your app (e.g. button taps, screen views, etc.) will appear automatically in the list of events that compose your goal.  Trigger each event you want to use in your funnel, then click and drag the events to arrange them in the correct order.
* Delete any events you don't want to use as part of your funnel.
* Give your goal a name.
* Click 'Save Goal'

Artisan will begin calculating the historical performance of your app according to the newly created funnel, and these results will appear over the next few hours.

<div class="note note-hint">
  <p>NOTE: Artisan Goals can use any combination of manually added events and those observed using the Interactive Goal Builder, up to 10 events total.</p>

### Viewing a Goal

To view the status of any of your Artisan Goals, navigate to the 'Goals' area in the Artisan navigation bar and select the goal you want to view from the list.

The goal report is automatically populated with all of the historical data of your app, and is kept up-to-date in real time. This report data is filterable by date range, and shows the following four pieces of information about your goal:

* Overall performance across each of the funnel goal steps for the specified date range.
* Table defining the number of sessions that have reached each step of the goal across the entire date range.
* Historical trends of the goal conversion rate.
* Historical overview of how many sessions have reached each step for each day since the beginning of the date range.

### Changing a Goal
Once built, a funnel goal cannot be changed; that is, you cannot add or delete the screens that make up the funnel of your goal. If you must change the makeup of your funnel, you will need to delete the current funnel goal, and create a new one with the correct screens and interactions.

### Changing the duration
You can select the period of time that your goal is measuring. Since Artisan retroactively fits the funnel to your data, any time after the date the SDK was installed is available for viewing.

### Deleting a Goal
To delete a goal, you must be in main Goals summary page. Click the gear next to goal youâ€™d like to change. Here you can delete the goal, or change the name of the goal.
