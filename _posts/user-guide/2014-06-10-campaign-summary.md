# Campaigns

## Viewing Campaign Results

After you've started your campaign and your users have started interacting with your app, your campaign results will start to populate. You can reach your campaign results at any time by clicking on the name of your campaign from the Campaigns page.

## In-App Notification Results

When your In-App Notification campaign begins, the campaign results screen will automatically display how your campaign is performing in near real-time.  Key performance indicators that Artisan collects include:

* **Total Impressions** -- The total number of times your in-app message has been encountered.
* **Tap-Through Rate** -- The percentage of time the 'Call to Action' was triggered when your in-app message was encountered.
* **Audience Size** -- The number of users for your app who are eligible to receive this in-app notification.
* **Conversion Rate** -- The percentage of time the Conversion Goal was triggered after a user receives this in-app notification.

### Trends

Artisan will also track how your campaign performs over time, to determine the overall health of the campaign and its impact on the enduring use of your app by engaged users.  Trends that Artisan will observe for in-app campaigns include:

#### Tap-Through and Dismissal Rate
The **Tap-Throughs** and **Dimissals** charts indicate how the tap-through and dismissal rates for your in-app campaign have changed over time, providing insight on when your campaign is reaching the saturation point for the targeted audience and how effective it has been in driving conversions.

#### Impression Counts
The **Total Impressions** and **Unique Impressions** charts keep track of the cumulative number of message impressions that have been delivered.  The uniques impressions chart tracks how many unique users have received the campaign, while the total chart tracks all impressions (including cases where the same user sees the campaign multiple times).

#### Sessions & Session Length
The Sessions and Session Length charts display the number of sessions and the length of time your users used your app both during your campaign and before your campaign start date.

The blue dotted line represents the start of your campaign. We show you a short period of time, relative to the length of your campaign, before your campaign start date so you can determine whether or not sessions and session length increased or decreased during your campaign.

## Push Notification Results

Once your Push Notification campaign begins, the campaign results screen will include key information about how your campaign is performing to determine if your campaign is driving conversion and user retention.

Key performance indicators that Artisan collects include:

* **Messages Sent** -- Total number of push messages sent to your users during the campaign.  The **Bounce Rate** is noted beneath this count, and indicates what percentage of these messages failed to reach their destination because the user turned off push notifications or deleted the app off their phone.
* **Open Rate** -- The Open Rate lets you know what percentage of your users actually opened your push notification.
* **Audience Size** -- The number of users for your app who are eligible to receive this push notification.  Includes all people who are a member of the targeted segment who have push messaging enabled for your app.

### Trends

Artisan will also track how your campaign performs over time, to determine the overall health of the campaign and its impact on the enduring use of your app by engaged users.  Trends that Artisan will observe for push campaigns include:

#### Push Notification Open Time
Push Notification Open Time is a scatter-plot style chart that shows you the days and times your users opened your push notification. Understanding when your users open your push notifications will help you discover the best time to send push notifications to maximize engagement with your users.

#### Sessions & Session Length
The Sessions and Session Length charts display the number of sessions and the length of time your users used your app both during your campaign and before your campaign start date.

The blue dotted line represents the start of your campaign. We show you a short period of time, relative to the length of your campaign, before your campaign start date so you can determine whether or not sessions and session length increased or decreased during your campaign.
