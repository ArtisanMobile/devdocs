#Analyze

Analyze gives unprecedented insight into mobile user behavior, allowing customers to track every user interaction without writing code.

Features of Artisan Analyze include:

**Auto Event Collection:**  Automatically collect all data from the first day the Artisan SDK is in place.  Collect not just the user, app, and session basics that other products collect, but also collect the behavior within the app, including all screen views and all control events.  Enables complete visibility into every UI-driven action in your app.

**Goal Builder:**  Build funnels and objectives to measure within your app.  Select any action within your mobile app, such as adding items to a cart, and measure your performance retroactively from the moment you began using Artisan. Analyze anything without foresight.

**Event Tagging:**  Enrich your auto-collected events, sessions, page views, and user info.  Attach prices, SKUs, category information, and anything else on the screen for highly-precise segmentation.

**User Segmentation:**  Offers all of the essential base analytics reports and segments these reports by user demographic and behavior data, including age, gender, and execution of tagged events.

Analyze provides you visibility into user behavior in your app. Analyze helps you to understand the success rate of users completing certain tasks and identifies where problem areas might reside in the app. Analyze's tagging capability enables to you to associate specific parts of your app like a label with a specific user behavior such as the price of an item with the tapping of checkout or the size selected of a particular item with the associated price.

##Event Tracking

Artisan Analyze is automatically collecting all key information about how your app is being used by all of your current users. All events are not user-specific; no personal information is collected and analytics queries are made in aggregate. Events that are automatically collected include:

* Screen Views
* Button Taps
* Segmented Control Taps
* Table Cell Selections
* Session Start and Completion

Events and their names are inferred automatically from your app. Additionally, events can be manually collected via the Artisan Analyze In-Code API.  This API is available for capturing events triggered within the business logic of your app or events not automatically collected by Artisan.  More information on thie Artisan In-Code API is available in our Development Documentation Portal.

##Viewing Your Reports

Artisan Analyze gives you deep insight into your app with Analyze reports. All reports provide the ability to specify the span of time you would like to focus in on, as set by the date filtering tools in the top-right corner of the screen.

###Users
The Users Report provides an understanding of new vs. existing users, along with a range of recurring user statistics (e.g. unique users from yesterday).   Note that users in this case are in fact unique users over the specified timespan.

###Sessions
The Sessions Report indicates session trends for the number of sessions and average session length, computed either daily or over a specified period of time.  Note that a session is the determined as a single instance where a user started and then closed the app, and session time is determined from the time from app opens to when it is closed or backgrounded on the device.
 
###Devices
The Devices Report demonstrates the number of sessions per device type both in a trend line as well as daily.

###Events
The Event Report provides visibility into specific behaviors both collected automatically by Artisan (e.g. button taps, control taps, etc.) and collected manually in the app itself.   Each event is listed in the Event Listing page, and selecting an event will produce a report on how many times that event has occurred as well as how many times that event has occurred per user. These reports can be filtered by both date range and tag. To learn more about tagging, please refer to Getting Started: Tagging.
