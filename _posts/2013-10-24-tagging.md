#Event Tagging

Tagging is the means through which you add context and richness to the events that Artisan is collecting automatically.  Through tagging, any screen element can be associated with an event Artisan collects for filtering and segmentation.  For example, if you have a share button located on an item detail screen in your app, you can associate the name of that item with the tapping of the share button. You can then filter and segment the data for that action by item name.

##Tagging Events

Click \'Create New Tag\' on the right hand side of the screen

Click Start Tagging

Select the control that triggers the event you wish to tag.  For example, if you wish to tag the \'Add to Cart\' event, tap the \'Add to Cart Button\'.  This is the behavior we are going to associate with a tagged identifier (such as Price or Product Name).

Click Next

Now select a Label or Text Field (e.g. the price or product description) to be associated with the behavior or action you indicated in the previous step (i.e. Checkout)

Type the name for your tag in the text field.  This name will identify the tag when you use it to filter the given event in the Event Report for that event.  Then click Finish.

Once you\'re done creating all of the different tags for the event, click \'Close\' to save all of the tags.

To see reports on the relationship between the target behavior and the label or text field, go to the Events Report within Artisan Analyze.  This can be reached by (a) navigating to the \'Analyze\' area on the Artisan Sidebar, (b) selecting the \'Events\' tab, and then (c) selecting the event in the Events List that you tagged during the previous steps.  Refer to the Getting Started:Events section for more information.

In the dropdown above the Event Report, the tag that was just identified should be available.  This tag will allow you to filter the Event Report to show only events that happened while this tag was present on the screen (i.e. show only when this event happeend with \'$24\' shown as the Product Price).

You can then enter the data (e.g. Product Price of $24) to see the trend line associated with that product.

Best Practice is to use a minimum of three tags per screen e.g. add to cart button + price + product description to allow maximum filter capability.

  <p>Note: Tags allow for filtering of events based on data collected from the moment the tag is created onwards.  Data collected from before the tag was created will not appear in the filtered report.</p>
