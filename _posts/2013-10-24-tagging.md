#Event Tagging

Tagging is the means through which you add context and richness to the events that Artisan is collecting automatically.  Through tagging, any screen element can be associated with an event Artisan collects for filtering and segmentation.  For example, if you have a share button located on an item detail screen in your app, you can associate the name of that item with the tapping of the share button. You can then filter and segment the data for that action by item name.
