#2.1.5 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

Small tweak to help support device whitelisting (to cut down on the number of times the Artisan Gesture needs to be performed)

* [UPDATED] The SDK now passes over the DeviceId when it first connects to artisantools.com for use in future whitelisting.
