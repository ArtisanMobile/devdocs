#iOS SDK 2.3.3 Release Notes

Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

This release updates our geolocation detection to support the new iOS 8.x permission checks.

* [UPDATED] When running iOS 8.x, use the new Apple permission check so that we only gather device geolocation when the app has permission to always receive geolocation updates.
