# Artisan Personalize
Identify your most important users and segment them into groups so that you can deliver unique user experiences.

## What is Personalization?
Personalization is a process that combines segmentation and publishing. Segmentation is defining a group of users that share a specific characteristic or behavior pattern that matter to you. 

Once you've identified segments, publishing gives you the ability to distribute customized screen designs to those segments. Personalize enables you to target specific groups of users with custom content and designs so you can increase engagement, conversions, and create positive user experiences. 

## Getting Started
To start off with Personalize, you'll need to group your users by some common characteristic that is meaningful to your business and app. Common segments include gender, location, loyalty level or past purchasing behavior. Once you have identified the appropriate user groups or segments you then use Personalize to create custom user experiences (screen designs) that best serve that segment. 

### Features of Artisan Personalize include:

* **Advanced Segmentation:** Create specific audience segments based on age, gender, and location (or other app-specific data), as well as more advanced segments based on behavioral patterns and trends. 
* **Targeted Content:** Design and publish content specific to different audience segments.
* **Personalized Power Hooks:** Create configurable variables in your app that exposed to business users and can be customized and personalized. Developers write code for the hook only one time. From that point on, business users can easily make modifications without the need to re-write code. For example, a power hook might be established to offer discounts. Based on analytics, the business user decides to push different discounts to different audience segments, which he or she can easily do without bothering developers whenever a change is made.

## Segmenting Users
A Segment is a group of users that share a specific characteristic or behavior pattern that matters to you.
You define a segment, and then create a design that is targeted towards that segment and publish a custom design to that group of users. All with the purpose of delivering personalized experiences.

Segment dimensions that are available right away for use include:
* Device type
* OS version
* App version
* Language
* Location
