# Getting Around

## Notifications
The Notification center helps you stay on top of your app's performance. Artisan will send you alerts on how your app is performing, A/B test suggestions, Goal Funnel trends, and other helpful communications. You can access the Notification Center by clicking on the Notifications icon on the menu bar.

If you have an unread message, the notification icon will be highlighted and display the number of unread messages waiting for you:

You can open you notification inbox any time by clicking on the notifications icon in menu. Your notification inbox contains read and unread items. Unread items are indicated by a bold subject name. To open a notification, click on a notification to open and read the notification details. You can close a notification by clicking the Close icon, located on the top right of the notification.

## Account Settings

The account settings screen can be accessed by hovering over the user icon to the right of the notifications icon at the top of your screen. On this page you will be able to view your account usage and manage user access controls.

### Account Usage

View your account usage, including the number of monthly active users (MAU) used during the current and prior calendar month.  Please <a href="mailto:support@useartisan.com">contact us</a> with any questions regarding account usage.

<div id="manage-users"></div>

### Manage Users

Invite team members to our platform by selecting the "Invite a User" button and providing the neccessary information.  Roles currently available for use are as follows:

<ul>
	<li><strong>User</strong> - full platform access</li>
	<li><strong>Read Only User</strong> - can only view reports and build funnels</li>
	<li><strong>Administrator</strong> - full platform access, can also add and remove user accounts</li>
</ul>

<div class="note note-important">
  <p>Important: Please remember to remove users from your account that leave the organization.</p>
</div>

### Two-factor Authentication

From your Account Settings you can enable two-factor authentication for your organization. This will require all users in the organization to enter an 8-digit code in addition to their username and password in order to access Artisan. Authentication codes are sent via email to the address associated with the user account.

A two-factor code will be required each time the user authenticates with Artisan from the web and when connecting a device to Artisan. You can opt to "Remember me for 30 days" when logging in to artisantools.com. When connecting a device your authentication token will be stored and you can make the Artisan gesture to re-connect without having to enter your credentials as long as your session is valid or until you log out on the web or via the "Log Out" button on the Artisan overlay (or by tapping the Artisan notification for Android).

When logging in each user has a maximum of 3 attempts to enter a valid two-factor code. If the maximum attempts have been made the user will be locked out of the Artisan platform. As an organization administrator you can unlock the user by clicking "Unlock" next to their user account information.

<div class="note note-important">
	<pFor connecting devices to Artisan with two-factor authentication you will need to have at least Artisan iOS SDK v2.3.5 or Artisan Android SDK v2.3.2 installed.</p>
