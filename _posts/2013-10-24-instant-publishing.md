#Instant Publishing

With Canvas, you are able to make changes to the design of your application and publish those changes immediately to your customers. In addition, you have the option of publishing these changes to a particular segment. If at any point you would like to make a quick change to your app, whether it be fixing a typo or uploading a new image, Artisan provides you an easy way to do so through Canvas.


##Making Changes to Your App
* Connect to Artisan
* Once connected, go to the app map
* At the app map, you will have the option on the right "Modify and Personalize"
* On Canvas, design the changes that you would like to push out to your users
* Select the segment you would like to publish to (Note: If you do not pick a segment, the changes will be pushed to all users)
* Once you have finished making your designs, hit Publish on the top right corner
