<h1>Getting Started With Artisan</h1>

<p>Artisan is an all-in-one platform for mobile analytics, A/B testing, personalization, and marketing automation. We help you better understand you app, give you the ability to send push notifications, personalize the content you deliver to your users and much more.</p>

<h2>Before You Get Started</h2>
<p>Before you get started, you're going to need a few things:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://artisantools.com/signup" target="_blank">An Artisan user account</a></li>
	<li>Access to your app's code to install the Artisan SDK</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding Your App</h2>

<p>Adding an app to the Artisan platform is a simple process, but needs to be done by a developer.</p>

<ul>
	<li>After logging in to Artisan, click the "Add an App" button located at the top left of the list of apps.</li>
	<li>Give you app a name and select your OS type (iOS or Android).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you've created an app in Artisan you need to add the Artisan SDK to your app.</p>
