<h2>Adding Your First App</h2>

<p>Adding an app to the Artisan platform is a simple process, but needs to be done by a developer with access to your app's source code. This process typically takes about 15 minutes to complete.</p>

<ul>
	<li>After <a href="https://www.artisantools.com/login" target="_blank">logging in to Artisan</a>, click the "Add Your First App" button</li>
	<li>Give you app a name and select your OS type (iOS or Android)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you've created an app in Artisan you need to add the Artisan SDK to your app.</p>
