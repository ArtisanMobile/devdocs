<h1>Adding Your App</h1>

<p>Adding an app to the Artisan platform is a simple process, but needs to be done by a developer.</p>

<ul>
	<li>After logging in to Artisan, click the "Add an App" button located at the top left of the list of apps.</li>
	<li>Give you app a name and select your OS type (iOS or Android).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you've created an app in Artisan you need to add the Artisan SDK to your app.</p>
