Artisan Developers Site

The docs site is all on the gh-pages branch.

FYI, when you merge a change it goes live immediately!

## Testing Locally

```
 gem install jekyll
 jekyll serve --watch
```

Now browse to http://localhost:4000

## Anvil

Also, KJ recommends using something like anvilformac.com to run the site locally.
